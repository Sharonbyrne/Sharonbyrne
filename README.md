### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I love coordinating awesome software projects. I am learning how to use Github to manage a software project instead of Jira. I hope to check out all the Github features and find awesome project management plug-ins. If you have travelled this road too I would love to hear any tips you may have.

Thanks! ðŸ˜„
